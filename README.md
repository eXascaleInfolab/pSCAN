# pSCAN - Fast and Exact Structural Graph Clustering (with overlaps)

The paper: *["pSCAN: Fast and Exact Structural Graph Clustering"](https://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~ljchang/pdf/icde16-pscan.pdf) by Lijun Chang, Wei Li, Xuemin Lin,Lu Qin and Wenjie Zhang, ICDE'16*. The [presentation slides](https://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~ljchang/pdf/icde16s-pscan.pdf) are also available.

Author: Dr. [Lijun Chang](https://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~ljchang/) <ljchang@cse.unsw.edu.au>

This is the original version of pScan with the purpose to extend I/O to be natively applicable for the [PyCaBeM](https://github.com/eXascaleInfolab/PyCABeM) clustering benchmark.
